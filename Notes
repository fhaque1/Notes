Aim: Mongo likes py

Working with pymongo

	from pymongo import MongoClient
	
	Connecting to a mongodb server and database

		server = MongoClient(<IP>)

Server
Databases
Collections
Documents


from pymongo import MongoClient
server = MongoClient('149.89.150.100')
db = server.mydb		<-- Database
c = db.students  <-- Collection
c.count() #number of records in the collection



To access databses and collections, you can user either [] or .

	db = server['mydb']
	db = server.mydb

Databases and collections are not created until a document has been added to them!

To add a document

	1. Create a dictionary
	2. Insert it to the collection

		doc = { 'name':'bob', 'age': 65}
		c.insert_one(doc) #adds single document to collection

	You can insert a list of couments with insert_many()
