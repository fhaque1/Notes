Aim: Mongo likes py

Working with pymongo

	from pymongo import MongoClient
	
	Connecting to a mongodb server and database

		server = MongoClient(<IP>)

Server
Databases
Collections
Documents


from pymongo import MongoClient
server = MongoClient('149.89.150.100')
db = server.mydb		<-- Database
c = db.students  <-- Collection
c.count() #number of records in the collection



To access databses and collections, you can user either [] or .

	db = server['mydb']
	db = server.mydb

Databases and collections are not created until a document has been added to them!

To add a document

	1. Create a dictionary
	2. Insert it to the collection

		doc = { 'name':'bob', 'age': 65}
		c.insert_one(doc) #adds single document to collection

	You can insert a list of couments with insert_many()

Aim: Where'd mongo put that data?

Retrieving data from mongodb 

	.find()
		Collection method that returns a cursor object that can be used to iterate through all the documents in a collection

	.find_one()
		Collection method that returns a single document as a dictionary

	Querying a mongodb

		.find() and .find_one() can take an argument to narrow the resulting document

		Queries in pymongo are formatted as documents

			foo.find( {'age': 25} )
			col.find( {'name': 'alison'} ) --> returns cursor
			col.find_one( {'name': 'alison'} ) --> returns document
			No error if search is empty

Search criteria can be modified using '$and', '$or' and '$not'

	foo.find_one( {
					'$and' : [ 
						{'name':'bob'}, 
						{'age': 25}
					]})

	Using inequalities in searches
		
		$gt, $lt, $gte, $lte, $ne

		foo.find( {'age': {'$gte' : 21}} )

2/8

Aim: upDAT(A)ing mongo.

Modifying data

	.delete_one(<QUERY>)
		Deletes the first document that matches the query

	.delete_many(<QUERY>)
		Deletes all the documents that match the query

	.update_one(<QUERY>, <OPERATION>)
		Updates a document that matches the query 
		
		Operation is a document that matches an udate operationL

			'$set'
				Change the value of a field

			'$unset'
				Remove a field

			'$inc'
				Increment the value of a field

Aim: Canvasing the area. 

HTML5
	Redesign of HTML with a focus on making the more "modern" features of web browsers easy to work with

	"Designed around javascript and a standardized

	Includes built in support for audio and video playback

	Includes an element that can be directly drawn on

Canvas 
	HTML5 element that provides a drawing area.
	
	Javascript functions can draw onto a canvas element.

		You must declare what context you are drawing in. 

		For example 2d drawing, 3d drawing, raw bitmap rendering...

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<h1> Canvas Fun! </h1>

<canvas width="500" height="300" id="slate">
</canvas>

</html>


var ctx = c.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillRect(50,75,100,200);
ctx.fillStyle = '#ff00ff'

Aim: Your path to success starts here!

javascript path functions

	Path are used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves

	A context can keep track of one path at a time. 

	The path is not drawn unitl stroke() is called 
	
	A path is considered done when a new beginPath() is called. 

	
	beginPath()
		Starts or resets the current path

	moveTo(X, Y)
		Moves the path to position (x, y), does not result in a line or a filled in section

	lineTo(X, Y)
		Moves the path to position (x, y), will result in a line and a filled in section

	closePath()
		Results in a line from the current position to the starting position

	fill()
		Fills the interior of the path, will not work if the path has fewer than 3 points in it. 

	arc(X, Y, RADIUS, START, END)
		Creates an arc path with center (X, Y) with START and END as the defining angles in radians

	e.preventDefault();
		Prevents default behavior

2/16
Aim: Let's Get Animated

When we won't be using for animation 
	setInterval

What we will be using 
	requestAnimationFrame

Why?
	requestAnimationFrame tells the browser to run a specified function before drawing the next frame.

	The browser will attempt to run ~60 frames per second

	It lets the browser handle when the code should be exectured (as opposed to setInterval which is based on specific times).

	It also lets the browser pause animation when a page is not in the foreground

2/27
Aim: What's your vector victor?

	XML
		eXtensible Markup Language
		
		It is not a formatting language (like HTML)

		A framework for creating markup based grammars

JSON: 
	s = {"name":"bob","id":32}
XML: 
	<person>
		name: bob
		id: 32
	</person>

An XML namespace is defined by the tages and attributes associated with a specific XML language.

The <svg> element is designed to store SVG code (that is, SVG XML elements)
